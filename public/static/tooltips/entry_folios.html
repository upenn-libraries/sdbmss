<h1>Folios</h1>

<p>Enter number of folios. The SDBM traditionally accepts data about manuscripts composed of five or more folios. Manuscripts of less than 5 folios may be entered if the manuscript is not considered a fragment, of if it is a fragment, it is considered the sole surviving fragment of a larger manuscript. The New SDBM is open to broad interpretations of this particular guideline.</p>

<p>When a source provides a collation formula, do not include additional material (such as endleaves) in the folio count. For example, if given the formula ii + 256 + ii, enter 256 in the FOLIO field. Enter collation formulas in the OTHER INFO field.</p>
