<h1>Folios</h1>

<p>Enter number of folios. The SDBM accepts data about manuscripts composed of five or more folios.</p>

<p>When a source provides a collation formula, do not include
additional material (such as endleaves) in the folio count. For
example, if given the formula ii + 256 + ii, enter 256 in the FOLIO
field. Enter collation formulas in the OTHER INFORMATION field.</p>
