<h1>Author</h1>

<p>Enter name as found in Author Lookup Table, which is automatically
suggested in the text box when you begin typing. If an Author is new,
i.e. not in the Author Lookup Table, create an authority name by
clicking on the Create &gt;&gt;&gt; option. This action will open a
pop-up window where you can import an authority name in VIAF.</p>

<p>If no VIAF file for a name exists, create a standard manually using
    the SDBM Personal Name Standard:</p>

<p style="padding-left: 40px;">

common descriptors. Spell out common abbreviations of given names.</p>
