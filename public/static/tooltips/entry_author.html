<h1>Author</h1>

<p>Enter name as found in Author Lookup Table, which is automatically
suggested in the text box. With slight variations, author names follow
the Library of Congress Authorities database for authors. If an Author
is new, i.e. not in the Author Lookup Table, create an “Authority”
name based on LOC standards to enter in the Author field. Enter name
as given in catalog in Author As Recorded. Unlike the LOC, do not use
commas between names and hometowns or between names and common
descriptors. Spell out common of abbreviations of given names.</p>
