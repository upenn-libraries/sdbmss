<h1>Author As Recorded</h1>

<p>Enter the name exactly as given in the data source. This should be
a verbatim quotation from the text, repeating the original idiomatic
spelling, name order, abbreviation, and even case usage (usually
genitive). If a name is not given in the source, leave Author As
Recorded blank, even if the author can otherwise be inferred: in this
case, supply the inferred name in the Author field instead and note it
as such with the appropriate certainty symbol in the box next to the
Author name. The label “Anonymous” should be used only when given
exactly as such in the data source.</p>

<p>Note: Denote certainty of data with the appropriate symbol in the

<ul>
    <li>Checkmark = the source contains the information</li>
    <li>Question mark = the source expresses doubt about the information</li>
    <li>Asterisk = you (the data entry person) are providing the
        information, based on a strong inference. You can further explain
        your reasoning in the Other Information field, if you desire.</li>
</ul>
