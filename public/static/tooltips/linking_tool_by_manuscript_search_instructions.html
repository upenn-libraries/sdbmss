Click the <b>Show potential links</b> button to automatically search the SDBM for possible links. A pop-up window will appear if no potential links are found. Click “OK” to return to linking tool. When you find matches, click the <b>Add this entry to manuscript</b> option in the far left column of the search result to add the entry to the entry queue above.
