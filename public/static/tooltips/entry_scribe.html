<h1>Scribe</h1>

<p>Enter name as found in Scribe  Name Authority, which is automatically suggested in the text box. If a Scribe is new, i.e. not in the Author  Name Authority, create an Authority name by clicking on the <b>Find or Create Authority Name</b> option. This action will open a pop-up window where you can import an Authority name in VIAF.</p>
          
<p>If no VIAF file for a name exists, create a standard manually using the SDBM Personal Name Standard:</p>
 
<p style="padding-left: 40px">Last name, First Name, Title, Life Dates</p>
 
<p>Do not create an Authority Name for names that are not specific. For example, if the name provided in a source is "John", include that name in the As Recorded field only. You should create an Authority Name only when the known name is specific enough to distinguish the person from other people with similar names.</p>

<p>Descriptive notes about the scribe that do not contain an explicit name, such as, “In a contemporary hand” or “Several hands”, should be entered in OTHER INFO.</p>

<p>Note: Denote certainty of data with the appropriate symbol in the box next to field. A checkmark appears as default. Click on the box to cycle through the following options:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
Checkmark = the source contains the information
  </li>
  <li>
Question mark = the source expresses doubt about the information
  </li>
  <li>
Asterisk = you (the data entry person) are providing the information, based on a strong inference. You can further explain your reasoning in the Other Information field, if you desire.
  </li>
</ul>
