<h1>Provenance Agent Authority Name</h1>

<p> Enter the Authority Name of the provenance agent. Record only those provenance agents described explicitly in the source. When a source provides multiple provenance agents, list them in chronological order. Authority Names already entered into the database will appear in the Provenance Agent  Name Authority as you type. If a name is new, i.e. not in the  Name Authority, create an Authority name by clicking on the Find or Create Authority Name option. This action will open a pop-up window where you can import an Authority name from VIAF.</p>
<p>If no VIAF file for a name exists, create an Authority Name manually.</p>
<p>For personal names, use the SDBM Personal Name Standard:</p>

<p style="padding-left: 40px;">
    Last name, First Name, Title, Life Dates<br/>
</p>
 
<p>Do not create an Authority Name for names that are not specific. For example, if the name provided in a source is "John", include that name in the As Recorded field only. You should create an Authority Name only when the known name is specific enough to distinguish the person from other people with similar names.</p>

common descriptors. Spell out common abbreviations of given names.</p>

<p>Enter any additional details about the person or institution, such
as dates, in the Comments field.</p>

box next to field. A checkmark appears as default. Click on the box to
cycle through the following options:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Checkmark = the source contains the information</li>
    <li>Question mark = the source expresses doubt about the information</li>
    <li>Asterisk = you (the data entry person) are providing the information, based on a strong inference. You can further explain your reasoning in the <em>Other Information</em> field, if you desire.</li>
</ul>
