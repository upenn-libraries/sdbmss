<h1>Selling Agent</h1>

<p>Enter the standard name of the selling agent. Standard names
already entered into the database will appear in the Provenance Agent
Lookup Table as you type. If a name is new, i.e. not in the Lookup
Table, create an authority name by clicking on the Create &gt;&gt;&gt;
option. This action will open a pop-up window where you can import an
authority name in VIAF. If no VIAF file for a name exists, create a
standard manually using the SDBM Personal Name Standard:</p>
