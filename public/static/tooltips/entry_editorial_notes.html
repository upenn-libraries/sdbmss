<h1>Editorial Notes</h1>

<p>Enter any additional comments or questions regarding the
entry. This field is intended to contain user comments, not details
found in the data source itself.</p>

<p>Remember that entries reflect what the <b>source</b> provides, not
necessarily the reality of what the <b>manuscript</b> is. You should
not try to correct a source. Known errors in the data should be
preserved but noted in this field or the <b>Comments</b> field. If you
believe the source description is in error, create a new <b>Personal
Observation</b> entry. If there is not already a <b>Manuscript
Record</b> created, you will be asked to create this record.</p>
