<h1>Common Title</h1>

<p>Enter any known alternate title for the work, if desired. For
example, if a source gives a translation of an original title, enter
the original title or the common Latin title. </p>

<p>If a source provides only a description of contents or a generic title
(a term that indicates a category of books rather than a specific
text), give the English equivalent of the description or generic
title.</p>

<p>e.g.: Bible, Book of Hours, Breviary, Gradual, Missal, etc.</p>
