<h1>Date for Search</h1>

<p>Enter an appropriate range of dates for the manuscript. Use a minus
sign before the year to denote B.C.E. dates (e.g. -10 for 10
B.C.E.).</p>

<p>Enter the start date of the range in the first field, and the end
date of the range in the last field. This range allows your entry to
appear in a wider array of search results. Depending on the content
you enter for the Date as Recorded field, the SDBM may auto-populate
these fields. You can always change the auto-populated data.</p>
