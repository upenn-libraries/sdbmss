<h1>Date for Search</h1>

<p>Depending on the content you enter for the Date as Recorded field,
the SDBM may auto-populate these fields. You can always change the
auto-populated data. If the fields do not auto-populate, enter an
appropriate range of dates for the manuscript. Use a minus sign before
the year to denote B.C.E. dates (e.g. -10 for 10 B.C.E.).</p>

<p>Enter the start date of the range in the first field, and the end
date of the range in the last field. This range allows your entry to
appear in a wider array of search results.</p>
