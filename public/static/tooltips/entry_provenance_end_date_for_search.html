<h1>End Date for Search</h1>

<p>Enter an appropriate range of dates for the end of the possession
of the manuscript. Enter the start date of the range in the first
field, and the end date of the range in the last field. This range
allows your entry to appear in a wider array of search
results. Depending on the content you enter for the Date as Recorded
field, the SDBM may auto-populate these fields. You can always change
the auto-populated data.</p>
