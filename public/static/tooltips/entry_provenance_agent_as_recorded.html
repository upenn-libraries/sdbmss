<h1>Prov Agent as Recorded</h1>

<p>Enter the name of the provenance agent exactly as given in the data
source. This should be verbatim from the text, repeating the original
idiomatic spelling, name order, abbreviation, etc. A provenance agent
is any person or institution that impacted the provenance history of a
manuscript, such as an auction house, dealer, or owner. Record only
those provenance agents described explicitly in the source.  If this is a personal observation, enter Provenance Agent as given in a manuscript or leave blank.</p>
