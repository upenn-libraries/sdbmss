<h1>Artist</h1>

<p>Enter the Authority Name of an artist or artists. Authority Names
already included in the SDBM will appear in a drop-down list as you
type into this field. If no correct Authority Name appears, create a
new standard name by clicking the <b>Find or Create Authority Name</b> option from the
drop-down list. Follow the instructions in the pop-up window to create
the new standard name.</p>

<p>
    <div style="float: left;">e.g.:</div>
    <div style="padding-left: 40px;">
        Pucelle, Jean<br/>
        De Brailes, William<br/>
    </div>
</p>

<p>Do not include qualifiers such as "workshop of", "follower of" in the Artist Authority Name.  Note these qualifiers in the <b>Role</b> field.</p>

<p>Do not create an Authority Name for names that are not specific.  For example, if the name provided in a source is "John", include that name in the As Recorded field only.  You should create an Authority Name only when the known name is specific enough to distinguish the person from other people with similar names.</p>
