<h1>Scribe as Recorded</h1>

<p>Enter name of scribe exactly as given in data source. This should
be a verbatim quotation from the text, repeating the original
idiomatic spelling, name order, and even case usage. Descriptive notes
about the scribe that do not contain an explicit name, such as, “In a
contemporary hand” or “Several hands”, should be entered in OTHER
INFO.  If this is a personal observation, enter scribe as given in a manuscript or leave blank.</p>
