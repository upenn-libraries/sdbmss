    <h2>The New Schoenberg Database of Manuscripts</h2>

    <p>The Schoenberg Database of Manuscripts aggregates observations of premodern manuscripts drawn from over 12,000 auction and sales catalogues, inventories, catalogues from institutional and private collections, and other sources that document sales and locations of these books from around the world. Using 36 possible fields, entries in the Schoenberg Database of Manuscripts (SDBM)  record data from observations made in these sources and assist researchers in locating and identifying particular manuscripts, establishing provenance, and aggregating descriptive information about specific classes or types of manuscripts.</p>

    <p>The New Schoenberg Database of Manuscripts, in development since 2014,  allows you -- the members of its user community -- to become active, contributing partners in its development. Users can add entries, comment on other users entries, aggregate entries to created “manuscript records,” and help us build an authority file of persons and institutions associated with the movement of manuscripts across time and place.</p>

    <h2>NEH Grant Awarded to Develop the New Schoenberg Database of Manuscripts</h2>

    <p>In 2014, the SDBM received a $300,000 grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities to support a 3-year project to develop the New SDBM into an online, user-built, community driven collaborative tool for researching the historic and current locations of the world's pre-modern manuscripts. On July 25, 2016, the beta version of the New SDBM was launched to use and test the new functionality in a live environment. In the third year of the grant, the project team will continue to develop the application to enhance the user experience and community engagement.</p>

    <p>By June 2017, the New SDBM will be a robust, interactive resource for finding, indexing, and researching the world's manuscripts.</p>
