The linking tool consists of two windows: an entry queue in the top half of the page, and a search queue in the bottom half of the page. Use the search queue to search the database for entries that describe the same manuscript as your initial entry. As you add entries from the search queue to the entry queue, they will appear alongside your initial entry. Use the radio buttons in the far left columns to modify the relationships between the entries in the entry queue. Select <b>Link</b> for entries that describe the same manuscript Select <b>Fragment</b> for entries that describe fragments of a manuscript. Fragmented manuscripts are most obvious by sharing many manuscript details with their linked entries except for such key indicators as folio count and the most complete Title listings. Select <b>Possible</b> if you are unsure whether the entry describes the same manuscript. Click the <b>Save Changes</b> button to save the links youâ€™ve made between entries.
