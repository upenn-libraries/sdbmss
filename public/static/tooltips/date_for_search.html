<strong>Date For Search</strong>
<br />
<br />
Enter the range of years that will be used for searching and
faceting. These fields are auto-populated with suggestions, based on
the "Date As Recorded" field, but you may override them and provide
your own years here.
<br/>
<br/>
Ranges are considered "end-exclusive": the end date is not part of the
range. For a range containing only one year, the end date should be
the start date + 1.
