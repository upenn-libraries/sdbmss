<strong>Variant Author</strong>
<br />
<br />
Enter the name <em> exactly </em> as given in the data source. This should be an verbatim quotation from the text, repeating the original idiomatic spelling, name order, and even case usage (usually genitive). If a name is not given in the source, leave Variant Name blank, even if the author can otherwise be inferred; in this case, supply the inferred name in the Author field instead, surrounded by square brackets. The label "Anonymous" should be used only when given exactly as such in the data source.

<em>Note:</em> Render all accented letters as the equivalent without diacritical marks. e.g., &#224; / &#225; / &#226; &rArr; a, &#230; &rArr; ae, &#228; &rArr; ae, &#231; &rArr; c, &#232; / &#233; / &#234; &rArr; e, &#236; / &#237; / &#238; &rArr; i, &#339; &rArr; oe, &#246; &rArr; oe, &#252; &rArr; ue, etc.
