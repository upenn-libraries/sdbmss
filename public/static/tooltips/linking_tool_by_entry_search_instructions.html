Enter search terms into the search box below to bring up possible matches to link. Click <b>Show more search fields</b> beneath the default search box to reveal additional search fields. Click the <b>Show potential links</b> button to automatically search the SDBM for possible links. A pop-up window will appear if no potential links are found. Click “OK” to return to linking tool. When you find matches, click the <b>Add to queue</b> option in the far left column of the search result to add the entry to the entry queue above. Entries that are already linked to a <b>Manuscript Record</b> will display an option to link to an SDBM MS record, rather than the option to add the entry to the entry queue.
