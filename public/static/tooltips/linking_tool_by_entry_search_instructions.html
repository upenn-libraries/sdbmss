Enter search terms into the search box below to bring up possible matches to link. Click <b>+ add term</b> beneath the default search box to add more search fields.   When you find matches, click the <b>Add to queue</b> option in the far left column of the search result to add the entry to the entry queue above. Entries that are already linked to a <b>Manuscript Record</b> will display an option to link to an SDBM MS record, rather than the option to add the entry to the entry queue.
