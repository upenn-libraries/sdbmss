<p>To add a new entry, you first have to identify the source from which you are obtaining your data for the entry or entries you are creating.</p>

<p><b>What is a source?</b></p>

<p>A source is the origin of information for an entry. Sources can include auction and dealer catalogs, collection catalogs, published or unpublished inventories, censuses, an individual (you or someone else) who has made direct observations about a manuscript(s), etc.</p>

<p>Always check to see if your source already exists in the database so that you do enter a source that has already been entered. You can search for a source by filling out known details in the form below. As you type, search results will generate,  becoming more refined as you continue to type. When you see your source, click on it. If you do not find your source, create a new one.            </p>

<p><em>Tip: The <strong>Source Date</strong> is often the best place to start looking for a particular sale or publication because numbers are often more precise than words.</em></p>
