<strong>Duplicate MS</strong>
<p>If manuscript matches have been found, click "Manage Duplicates" and enter ID numbers of other matching records. The system will automatically tie records already matched into a group of related records, if it already exists. Records may be marked as "Duplicates", "Possible Duplicates (?)", and "Fragments (X)" of other manuscripts that were broken apart sometime during their ownership. See also Data Entry Manual.</p>
