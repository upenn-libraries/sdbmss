                        <p>No, the SDBM does not own any manuscripts. We gather data about any manuscript produced before 1600 CE and composed of five or more folios, regardless of geographic location or institutional affiliation. We may at some point change the date and folio limits if the user community believes this is the right course of action. Let us know what you think!</p>

                        <p>Larry Schoenberg created his personal database as an Excel file in 1997, then created an Access database as the spreadsheet grew and he added more fields. These early formats required character limits, thus frequently forcing him to abbreviate data. As he began sharing his spreadsheet with friends, the user base and scope of the project grew. In 2009, data standards were created and refined and fields were added with the intention of improving information quality. It has been and remains impossible for SDBM staff to go back through all early entries to update the data to current standards. We provide warning labels on those entries that were created prior to the development of the New SDBM.

                        Also, people just make mistakes sometimes. You can help us improve data quality by commenting on entries and adding Personal Observations to the database.</p>

                        <p>There are many ways to help us improve data. While you can never edit another user’s entry, we do encourage you to create a Personal Observation if you have knowledge of a manuscript that is different from data recorded in an entry. If you notice an error in the way that data may have been transcribed from a source, you can leave a comment at the bottom of the description to notify us of the problem. You can also email us at sdbm@pobox.upenn.edu if you prefer to keep your comments private, though you will miss out on potential conversations with other users. Keep in mind that the SDBM aims to reproduce data exactly as it is given in the a source (e.g. an auction catalogue).</p>

                        <p>It may also be that the catalog has been entered in such a way as to make it difficult to locate within the database. If you are having trouble finding something, email us at sdbm@pobox.upenn.edu.</p>

The authority field is there to link the record to a Name, Place, or Language Authority List maintained by the SDBM staff. It is our goal to make our Authority Lists linkable to other authorities such as the Virtual International Authority File (VIAF).
