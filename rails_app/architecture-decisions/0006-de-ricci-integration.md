# 6.  De Ricci Integration


Date: 2019-07-15

## Status

Accepted

## Context

A deliverable for the SDBM NEH rebuild grant was integration of scanned notes from Seymour de Ricci's unfinished survey of British Manuscript. The value in the cards lies in the notes on the manuscripts of named individuals and organizations that could be linked to or added to the SDBM name authority.

## Decision

The decision was to create a game that allows users to attach randomly selected cards to existing SDBM name entries or identify new names to be added. The data is stored in the SDBM database, but the PDFs of the notes are hosted by the Senate House Library at the University of London. For example,

- <https://dericci.senatehouselibrary.ac.uk/web_pdf/dericci_a_f_s.pdf>


## Consequences

Users have been able to connect de Ricci cards to existing and new Name records in the SDBM. Because the SDBM is served over HTTPS, there was a delay for release while the Senate House implemented HTTPS on the site.
