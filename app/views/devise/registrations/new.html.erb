        member of an engaged user-community devoted to the study and

        print. Whether a professional or citizen scholar, you, as a
        member of this community, can</p>

        <ul>
            <li>contribute data from the sources the SDBM has traditionally relied upon (e.g. auction and sale catalogs, institutional catalogues, published inventories, etc)</li>
            <li>create your own personal observations of a manuscript and where it may have been or is now</li>
            <li>link entries to show the transmission of a manuscript from one location to the next</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>We also hope you will take the opportunity to engage in
        virtual conversations with other users and give us feedback to

                        <p>Larry Schoenberg created his personal database as an Excel file in 1997, then created an Access database as the spreadsheet grew and he added more fields. These early formats required character limits, thus frequently forcing him to abbreviate data. As he began sharing his spreadsheet with friends, the user base and scope of the project grew. In 2009, data standards were created and refined and fields were added with the intention of improving information quality. It has been and remains impossible for SDBM staff to go back through all early entries to update the data to current standards. We provide warning labels on those entries that were created prior to the development of the New SDBM.

                        Also, people just make mistakes sometimes. You can help us improve data quality by commenting on entries and adding Personal Observations to the database.</p>

While you can never edit another user’s entry, we do encourage you to create a Personal Observation if you have knowledge of a manuscript that is different from data recorded in an entry. If you notice an error in the way that data may have been transcribed from a source, you can leave a comment at the bottom of the description to notify us of the problem. You can also email us at sdbm@pobox.upenn.edu if you prefer to keep your comments private, though you will miss out on potential conversations with other users. Keep in mind that the SDBM aims to reproduce data exactly as it is given in the a source (e.g. an auction catalogue).</p>
