sdbmss
======

The Schoenberg Database of Manuscripts. This is the Ruby on Rails /
Blacklight project reboot, started in late Nov 2014.

Note that we use 'sdbmss' everywhere in the code because 'sdbm' is the
name of a package in Ruby's standard library.

There are two ways to install, setup, and run this code.

* See [README_DOCKER.md](README_DOCKER.md) for running this
  application in Docker containers. This is the preferred method.

* See [README_OLD.md](README_OLD.md) for how to configure a Linux
  machine from scratch to run the application.
